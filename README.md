I have developed a Number Game which starts by displaying the message to the user.
In this task, there is a secret number chosen by the system and we have to guess the number.
Now there will be 5 attempts to guess the number.
The number which is given is whether too high or too low.
The number which is very high means the secret number is less than the number which we have recently entered.
The number which is very low means the secret number is more than the number which we have recently entered.
Now if we enter the correct number then you won the game.
If in 5 attempts you failed then the secret number will gets highlightd.
At the last there will be again a choice if you want to play the game again.
