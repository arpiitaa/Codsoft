# Codsoft - Task 3 (WORDCOUNT)
Java Programming Internship

It is a WORDCOUNTER where it reads the input of text and file path. 
In this the sentence which we enter is tell us the number of words, unique word and the frequency of each word which we have entered.
In this code, the main method prompts the user to enter 'T' for text input or 'F' for file input.
Based on the choice, it reads the input text or file using a Scanner or FileReader, respectively.
The countWords method takes the input text, splits it into an array of words using space or punctuation as delimiters, and counts the total number of words. 
It also counts the number of unique words by using a HashMap to store the frequency of each word encountered.
Finally, it displays the total word count, unique word count, and the frequency of each word.
And at the end it ends with exit.
