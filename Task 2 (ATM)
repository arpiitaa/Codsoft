Java Programming Internship

Implementation of an ATM machine class in Java that includes the user interface, options for withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance, 
as well as a separate class to represent the user's bank account balance.
In this implementation, the BankAccount class represents the user's bank account and contains methods for getting the balance, depositing funds, and withdrawing funds. 
The ATM class represents the ATM machine and includes methods for displaying options, processing user input, and performing the corresponding actions such as withdrawal, 
deposit, and checking the balance.

The main class Main creates an instance of BankAccount and ATM, and it repeatedly displays the menu of options and prompts the user for input until they choose to quit.
